                        Instructions to Rtype Protocol


Status of this Memo

    This document is the official Rtype Protocol. Distribution of this
    memo is unlimited.


Abstract
    
    The Rtype Protocol has been developed over the past two weeks. It
    was created to allow players to play multiplayer games. This
    document is about the Rtype Protocol. It explains to users how the 
    client interects with the server. //////\\\\\\\The protocol is using UDP
    connection.

1. Introduction

    The protocol was created to allow players to play multuplayer
    games. This document discribes the current Rtype Protocol. The
    protocol was developed using the UDP network protocol. Our
    system is based on the client/server model. It's suitable for
    running on many computers in distributed way. Our system is an
    access point for our clients.


    1.1 Server

        The server provides an access point for all clients on the same 
        network to create or join parties. It's multithreaded allowing
        to manage several games containing several players. It uses two
        threads per game. The first to receive the player's commands
        and add them to the waiting list. The second to execute the
        player's actions, then the game and send the necessary data for
        display. Each thread contains a different port.


    1.2 Client

        A client connects to the server to register. It sends commands
        to it using the udp socket. Then, it will receive a code
        allowing it to know if its order has been accepted. The client 
        uses two threads to manage the game. The first one allows you
        to receive the data necessary to display the game. The second
        one sends the game commansd to the server and displays the
        differeent elements on an interface.

       
       1.2.1 Commands

            To communicate with the server, the client uses its
            commands:

            -connect [Username] -> to register
            -quit -> quit the server

            -create [name_game] [nb_player] -> to create a game
            -join [name_party] -> join a party
            -display -> display games
            -leave -> leave the waiting room


            The client will then receive a code:

            Connection:
            -100 connection accepted
            -300 guit accept
            -401 impossible to connect whitout a username

            Game:
            -201 creation of accepted games
            -402 creation of rejected part (name or number of missing
            person)
            -202 you have joined a game
            -403 unable to join a gme whitout a name
            -204 you have received the different available and ongoing
            games
            -203 you left a game if you were in one



        
    
    Our sever allows "n" players on the same network to communicate
    with itself. The players will be able to find each other trought
    games. Connected clients can create or join games. The server can
    manage severel games containing several players. Users will be able
    to see the current games.
    One the game contains all its players it starts. During the game,
    players will be able to play together using the keys on the
    keyboard.

2. Example of usage

    A client can send a message to the server using an udp socket.
